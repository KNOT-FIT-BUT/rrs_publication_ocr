      "abstract": "A segmental hidden Markov model (SHMM) is a hidden Markov model (HMM) whose states are associated with sequences of acoustic feature vectors (or segments), rather than individual vectors. By treating segments as homogeneous units it is possible, for example, to develop better models of speech dynamics. This paper considers the potential benefits of a trajectory-based segmental HMM for speaker recognition. Text-dependent speaker verification (TDSV) results obtained on YOHO and text-independent speaker verification (TI-SV) results on Switchboard are presented. The YOHO results show a 44% reduction in false acceptances using the segmental model compared with a conventional HMM, while the Switchboard results do not show any improvement relative to a conventional Gausian Mixture Model (GMM) system. Further experiments were conducted to explain these results. They indicate that the priority of a \"segmental GMM\" is to model stationary regions and shed light on the role of delta parameters in conventional TI-SV.",

      "abstract": "A FPGA Rijndael encryption design is presented, which utilizes look-up tables to implement the entire Rijndael Round function. A comparison is provided between this design and similar existing implementations. Hardware implementations of encryption algorithms prove much faster than equivalent software implementations and since there is a need to perform encryption on data in real time, speed is very important. In particular, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are well suited to encryption implementations due to their flexibility and an architecture, which can be exploited to accommodate typical encryption transformations. A look-up table based Rijndael design achieves a speed of 12 Gbits/sec, which is a factor 1.2 times faster than an alternative design in which look-up tables are utilized to implement only one of the Round function transformations, and 6 times faster than other previous implementations.",

      "abstract": "The new approach to undergraduate DSP education at Purdue is based on a simple idea: emphasize applications. Students are assumed to have a significant exposure to sampling and discrete-time signals, systems, and transforms at the junior level. In the senior course, the traditional DSP topics of digital filter design, the DFT, radix-2 FFT's, and quantization are covered in the first five weeks of the semester. Coverage of these topics is augmented by treatment in the laboratory component of the course using diverse software tools and by Matlab based homework assignments. The remainder of the course is devoted to treating the topics of speech processing and image processing in substantial depth and involves a design project. The course has been very successful in terms of increasing enrollment and outstanding student evaluations.",

(Checkland and Scholes, 1990, 311-312) If the process of doing SSM is a learning system then in SSM an organisation has a means of instituting organisational learning. Respected authors (specifically Argyris and Schön) in the domains of management and organisational psychology have written on the topic of the Learning Organisation and provided definitions or indicators for such. These include Theory-of-Action, Organisational Ecology and Action Learning Perspective. In order to determine if SSM conforms as a valid means for organisational learning from the perspective of management and psychology, the process of doing SSM is compared with the indicators proposed by Argyris and Schön. The framework for analysing SSM developed by Barnden, Smith and Watson, (1995) is used to structure the comparison. The framework is a capability maturity model for the SSM process.",

      "abstract": "In Discrete MultiTone a cyclic prefix (CP) is inserted between symbols to ensure that samples from one symbol do not interfere with the samples of another symbol. The CP length is determined by the impulse response length of the effective physical channel. The cyclic prefix reduces the throughput of the transceiver. When the transceiver is used in a full-duplex environment the portion of the receive signal arising from echo must be reduced through the use of echo cancellation, the complexity of which is directly related to the length of the echo path impulse response. To alleviate both problems a short time-domain FIR filter can be used to shorten both the effective channel and echo impulse responses. This paper explores a joint optimal algorithm for determining the coefficients of this time-domain filter, resulting in reduced ISI and echo canceller complexity.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge of the bandwidth of a signal allows for extrapolation over a time interval that can be many times the length of the given segment. Computer results, utilizing a version of a one-step small-matrix minimum-energy procedure, have shown that such extrapolation is feasible in the presence of noise and coarse (5-bit) quantization. It is shown here, however, that such a minimum-energy procedure cannot produce enhanced spectral resolution even in the absence of noise. By generalizing a unifying model for such procedures to include non-minimum energy bandlimited extrapolation, a new algorithm is proposed that allows for tradeoffs to be made between enhanced spectral resolution and reduced sensitivity to out-of-band noise. This algorithm may also be utilized in two dimensions to enhance the spatial resolution of an aperture-limited sensor when viewing a region of limited extent. However, resolution enhancement by bandlimited extrapolation appears to be practical only if the resolution is extremely poor to begin with.",

The validity and accuracy of this analytic model is confirmed by comparing the calculated model quantization errors with actual simulation of the optimum LBG vector quantizer. We compute the mean squared reconstruction error(MSE) which depends on N the number of entries in each codebook, k the length of each codeword, and on the filter bank coefficients. We form this MSE measure in terms of the equivalent scalar quantization model and find the optimum FIR filter coefficients for each channel in the M-band structure for a given bit rate, given filter length, and given input signal correlation model. Specific design examples are worked out for a 4-tap filter in a two-band paraunitary structure. Theoretical results are confirmed by extensive Monte Carlo simulation.",

The AR parameters are then determined via the normal equations. Experimental results comparing the new method with other popular AR spectrum estimation methods, indicate that the new method achieves low bias and low variance AR parameter estimates.",

The local characteristics are obtained from stationary regions selected by M-band decomposition with an adaptive analysis window. The spectrum of each selected region is estimated with an all-pole model. In order to model only the spectral region of interest, Selective Linear Prediction (SLP) is used. By modeling the local spectrum, either independently or dependently, with respect to other enhanced spectral regions, and adjusting the model order to the local characteristics, a balanced-tradeoff between noise reduction and speech distortion can be achieved.",

To solve these problems, we propose in this paper a speech recognition method of incorporating the baseball game knowledge such as counting of inning, out, strike and ball. Due to this taskdependent knowledge, the proposed method can effectively prevent speech recognition errors. This method is formalized in the framework of probability theory and implemented in the conventional speech decoding (Viterbi) algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach improved the structuring situation segmentation accuracy as well as keywords accuracy.",

It is shown in this paper that the unconstrained FxLMS algorithm always converges to, if stable, the true optimum filter even if the estimation of the secondary path is not perfect, and its final Mean Square Error is independent to the secondary path. Moreover we show that the sufficient and necessary stability condition for the feed-forward unconstrained FxLMS is that the maximum phase error of the secondary path estimation must be within 90°, which is only the necessary condition for the feedback unconstrained FxLMS. The significance of the analysis on a practical system is also discussed. Finally we show how the results obtained in this paper can guide us to design a robust feedback ANC headset.",

Based on this characterization, we introduce Morphological Representation of Wavelet Data (MRWD), a novel coding framework for both image and video coding applications. MRWD departs from existing wavelet-based coders in its use of a radically different set of primitive operations -non-linear, morphological operations-, for efficiently encoding the wavelet data field. Simulation results are very encouraging: a preliminary algorithm based on the morphological data structure is able to achieve about 0,5 dB of gain in SNR over Shapiro's state-of-the-art zerotree-based wavelet coder [1] at a coding rate of 1 bpp for the \"Lenna\" image.",

We also show that four steering vectors with distinct DOA's are linearly independent if the ellipticity angles of the signals associated with any two of the four steering vectors are distinct. Moreover, every four steering vectors corresponding to circularly polarized signals with the same spin direction are linearly dependent. We then establish that five steering vectors are linearly independent if exactly two or three of them correspond to circularly polarized signals with the same spin direction. Finally, we demonstrate that given any five steering vectors, then for any DOA there exists a steering vector that is linearly dependent on the five steering vectors.",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a new method of automatically summarizing speech by extracting a limited number of relatively important words from its automatic transcription according to a target compression ratio for the number of characters. To determine a word set to be extracted, we define a summarization score consisting of a topic score (significance measure) of words and a linguistic score (likelihood) of the word concatenation. A set of words maximizing the score is efficiently selected using a dynamic programming (DP) technique. Japanese broadcast news speech transcribed using a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system was summarized. As a result 86% of important words in the original speech were correctly included in the summarizing sentences and 72% of the summarizing sentences could maintain the meanings of the original speech under the 60-70% summarization condition.",

This entails that the signal modeling is carried out through a rank deficient linear transformation and the expansion coefficients are no unique. In the finite dimensional case one solution for the coefficients (which provides the coefficients of Minimum Norm) is approached by the pseudo-inverse of the concomitant rank deficient transformation. In many applications this makes a great deal of sense. In other applications, however, the model-builder is not interested in a predictor that involves all the redundant factors. Instead, a predictor constructed out of the independent factors is sought. How to pick these factors is a problem of subset selection [5] and we shall advance here a new method for accomplishing such a goal.",

      "abstract": "A classical approach to interpolation of sampled data is polynomial interpolation. However, from the sampling theorem it follows that the ideal approach to interpolation is to convolve the given samples with the sinc function. In this paper we study the properties of the sinc-approximating kernels that can be derived from the Lagrange central interpolation scheme. Both the finite-extent properties and the convergence property are analyzed. The Lagrange central interpolation kernels of up to ninth order are compared to cardinal splines of corresponding orders, both by spectral analysis and by rotation experiments on real-life test-images. It is concluded that cardinal spline interpolation is by far superior.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we proposed and developed a practical algorithm to identify the motion blur, either symmetric or nonsymmetric. The algorithm is novel and has sound theoretical foundation. The extent and type of motion blur, modelling as five prototypes (square pulse, reversed ramp, forward ramp, reversed trapezoid and forward trapezoid), was found to be associated with the phase change experienced after two trial restorations, which can further be accurately estimated by using image registration algorithm. The characteristics of the algorithm is highly robust, for both measurement noise level and severity of blur. It can still provide satisfactory result when the noise level is up to 15 dB. The examples of blur identification for both simulation image and real image were conducted to demonstrate effective performance of the developed algorithm.",

Furthermore, it can easily be applied to real and real symmetric data with reduced arithmetic complexity by removing all redundancy in the algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Corpus-based learning methods for natural language processing now provide a consistent way to achieve systems with good performance. A number of statistical learning models have been proposed and are used in most of the tasks which used to be handled by rule-based systems. When the learning systems come to such a level as competitive as manually constructed systems, both large scale training corpora and good learning models are of great importance. In this paper, we first discuss that the main hindrances to the improvement of corpus-based learning systems are the inconsistencies or the errors existing in the training corpus and the defectiveness in the learning model. We then show that some machine learning methods are useful for effective identification of the erroneous source in the training corpus. Finally, we discuss how the various types of errors should be coped with so as to improve the learning environments.",

In fact, this formulation is wholly in error, which has misinformed the design of concert halls throughout this century. The correct formulation is in terms of the coherence length of the orchestral region and of the preservation of musical information by diffuse reflections in the body of the hall: discrete and causal physics. The wave-mechanical information theories of Henry, Gabor, and Leith and Upatnieks provide the definitive format for this solution. It agrees well with fact, is coherent , and has great explainatory power.",

Thus, there is a need for graphical tools which enhance the students' comprehension of these difficult concepts by allowing interactive learning. In this paper we present a software package to assist in the explanation and visualization of signal processing concepts for an educational environment. We provide a set of Java-based tools for understanding the concepts of convolution, spectral analysis, and pole/zero system response. The wide availability and platform-independence provided by Java make this tool highly portable and easily accessible to a broader audience of students than comparable systems based on Matlab or other commercial software.

Therefore, we need a good clutter rejector to remove as many clutters as possible, before feeding the most likely target detections to the classifier. We investigate the benefits of using dualband forward-looking infrared images to improve the performance of an eigen-neural based clutter rejector. With individual or combined bands as input, we use either principal component analysis or the eigenspace separation transform to perform feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. The transformed data is then fed to a properly trained MLP that predicts the identity of the input, which is either a target or clutter. Experimental results are presented on a dataset of real dualband images.",

The word models are comprised of successive clusters of states whose durations are governed by continuous densities.

Several lexical rules, along with conventional DTW matching method, are experimentally evaluated by both close vocabulary and open vocabulary tests in similar word environments. The results show the effectiveness of those stochastic modeling and systematic generation of word models",

For applications in which the entire observation sequence is known, we illustrate that rapid pruning of unlikely speaker model candidates can be achieved by reordering the time-sequence of observation vectors used to update the accumulated probability of each speaker model. The overall approach is integrated into a beam-search strategy and shown to reduce the time to identify a speaker by a factor of 140 over the standard full-search method, and by a factor of six over the standard beam-search method when identifying speakers from the 138 speaker YOHO corpus.",

      "abstract": "A coherent array imaging method is described that uses small groups of adjacent array elements called subarrays. For each firing event, only one subarray is used for transmit and receive, and all elements of the subarray transmit and receive in parallel. Phased array processing is used to focus and steer the subarray beam in transmit and receive. A sufficient number of beams are acquired such that the Nyquist sampling criteria is met for the subarray. The beams acquired from each subarray are upsampled, filtered, and combined with beams from all the other subarrays to form the final high-resolution image. A subarray-dependent reconstruction and restoration filter is applied to the subarray beams. The method significantly reduces the front-end hardware complexity compared to full phased array imaging. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

Interaction of ultrasound with exogenous nanoparticles with certain acoustic properties may provide cavitation selectively in tumors and, therefore, may provide safe and efficient delivery of anti-cancer drugs in cancer cells without damage to normal tissues. In this paper, we studied enhanced delivery of model macromolecular anti-cancer drugs with ultrasound-induced cavitation in mice bearing human colon (KM20) and breast (MCF-7) tumors. Fluorescent rhodamine-dextrans of different molecular weight (10, 70, and 2,000 kDa) served as model drugs simulating antisense oligonucleotides, antibodies, and genes, respectively. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor vasculature with CD31 was used to visualize tumor blood vessels. Our studies demonstrated enhanced penetration of the drugs from blood vessels into tumor interstitium when ultrasound was applied in combination with polymer nanoparticle injections. Our results suggest that this drug delivery technique can potentially be used for efficient cancer chemo- and biotherapy.",

The analysis functions approximate complex-modulated Gaussians as closely as desired and may be optimally localized in time and frequency. The Gabor Altering is performed indirectly by convolving a premodulated signal with a Gaussian-like window and demodulating the output. The window functions are either B-splines dilated by an integer factor m or quasi-Gaussians of arbitrary size generated from the n-fold convolution of a symmetrical exponential. Both approaches result in a recursive implementation with a complexity independent of the window size (O(N)).",

      "abstract": "A maximum a-posteriori approach for enhancing speech signals which have been degraded by statistically independent additive noise is proposed. The approach is based upon statistical modeling of the clean speech signal and the noise process using long training sequences from the two processes. Hidden Markov models (HMM's) with mixtures of Gaussian autoregressive (AR) output probability distributions are used to model the clean speech signal. A low order Gaussian AR model is used for the wide-band Gaussian noise considered here. The parameter set of the HMM is estimated using the Baum or the EM (estimation-maximization) algorithm. The enhancement of the noisy speech is done by means of reestimation of the clean speech waveform using the EM algorithm. An approximate improvement of 4.0-6.0 dB in signal to noise ratio (SNR) is achieved at 10 dB input SNR.",

Specifically, the effect of errors in the calculated autocorrelation values is considered. Analysis and numerical simulation reveal that the error sensitivity becomes acute when the poles are closely spaced, demonstrating one of the difficulties encountered when high resolution spectrum estimates are required. To remedy this problem, two modified spectrum estimation procedures are proposed for separating closely spaced poles. The first applies to situations where discrete time techniques are used to estimate the spectra of continuous time processes, and involves selecting the autocorrelation function sampling period to separate the poles. The second procedure involves desampling an autocorrelation sequence to artificially separate closely spaced poles. Numerical examples verify the improved resolution provided by both procedures.",

      "abstract": "We demonstrate the utility of a multiresolution approach for target detection in SAR imagery. Man-made objects exhibit characteristic phase and amplitude fluctuations as the image resolution is varied, while natural terrain has a random signature. We construct a number of detection strategies: an optimal invariant multiresolution detector based on a derived multiresolution increments process; and a generalized likelihood ratio detector to differentiate between a first-order autoregressive multiresolution increments process and white noise. We show that these schemes significantly outperform a standard energy detector operating on the finest available SAR resolution.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers the decomposition of video sequences into so-called video object planes, which is required for the content-based representation of visual objects in MPEG-4. A new segmentation algorithm will be described that identifies physical objects using a morphological motion filter. For the object of interest, a two-dimensional binary model is derived based on areas in the scene that are moving differently from the background. This model is updated each frame to pick up possible rotation and changes in shape of the object. Temporal correspondence is established by a Hausdorff object tracker. The binary model sequences guide the actual video object plane extraction. Since the model points correspond to edges detected by the Canny operator, a high object boundary location is achieved. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed technique can successfully extract physical object from video sequences.",

      "abstract": "A key to successful image compression is a combination of (1) energy compaction by appropriate transform algorithms to exploit data redundancy, (2) judicious quantization of compressed transform coefficients, and (3) efficient entropy encoding that takes advantage of different symbol rates. The reduced dimension image compression (ReDIC) algorithm consists of (1) a library of transform algorithms to exploit data redundancy in local subimage, (2) subspace filtering to maximally decorrelate transform coefficients over multiple subimages and to achieve additional dimension reduction to overcome the curse of dimensionality, (3) vector quantization (VQ) of compressed transform coefficients, and (4) entropy encoding of VQ indexes with Huffman or arithmetic coders. In this paper, we describe the ReDIC algorithm and discuss its application to image coding of still pictures and sonar spectrograms for low-latency, low-cost wireless or satellite transmission to shore processing stations. We quantify the impact of image compression on minimum detectable lines with deflection or detection index. We also compare the original and reconstructed spectrograms derived from real data at 52:1 compression ratio. We also discuss how image coding can be applied to pattern recognition.",

In this work, three different implementations of that algorithm are analyzed in detail: (i) one that keeps updated a pair of sums, that of input vectors and that of square input vectors, in order to save computations in estimating covariance matrixes on partially shared data; (ii) one, recently proposed in the literature, that exploits the encoding of the input signal with cumulative statistics for the efficient estimation of covariance matrixes ; and (iii) an original one, that encodes the input stream with the cumulative pair of sums of the first approach. The three approaches have been compared both theoretically and experimentally, and the proposed original approach will be shown to be the most efficient.",

We used a stochastic tree-based parser to generate a tagged and bracketed representation of the input text, and then interpreted this higher-level information to produce a ToBI-type prosodic annotation of the text. From this annotation an intonation contour was predicted for use in synthesising the speech. Results show that prediction of prosodic phrasing and focal prominence are improved by 56% and 62% respectively over previous methods compared against a human reading of the same test utterances.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents three 3rd and three 4th-order cumulant based algorithms for blind deconvolution and identification of the non-minimum phase (NMP) systems. In the algorithms, based on a noncausal AR model and a new theorem relating to the inverse filter coefficients, the problem of blind deconvolution and identification of a NMP system is reduced to that of solving the corresponding set of linear equations. Thus the uniqueness of solution can normally be guaranteed. Furthermore, only the diagonal slices of cumulants are employed in the algorithms, which results in the algorithms being simpler and more accurate. A simulation example is presented for the case of unskewed continuous input, and the feasibility and efficiency of the algorithms is confirmed.",

Accurate wire-frame tracking is of paramount importance for correct reconstruction of the encoded image, especially in the areas occupied by the lips and the eyes. An entirely new algorithm for tracking the motion of a semantic wire-frame (Candide) by analysis of the principal components of sub-images containing important facial features of the speaker's face is proposed. This algorithm is suitable for tracking both global motion (motion of the speaker's head) and local motion (motion of the facial features). The algorithm was tested on numerous head-and-shoulders sequences with excellent results.",

      "abstract": "Recently there is much interest in moving objects databases, and data models and query languages have been proposed offering data types such as moving point and moving region together with suitable operations. In contrast to most earlier work on spatio-temporal databases, a moving region can change its shape and extent not only in discrete steps, but continuously. Examples of such moving regions are oil spills, forest fires, hurricanes, schools of fish, spreads of diseases, or armies, to name but a few. Whereas the database will contain a \"temporally complete\" representation of a moving region in the sense that for any instant of time the current extent and shape can be retrieved, the original information about the object moving around in the real world will most likely be a series of observations (\"snapshots\"). We consider the problem of constructing the complete moving region representation from a series of snapshots. We assume a model where a region is represented as a set of polygons with polygonal holes. A moving region is represented as a set of slices with disjoint time intervals, such that within each slice it is a region whose vertices move linearly with time. Snapshots are also given as sets of polygons with polygonal holes. We develop algorithms to interpolate between two snapshots, going from simple convex polygons to arbitrary polygons. The implementation is available on the Web.",

Our simplified model based on a linear differential equation can successfully reproduce the subthreshold membrane properties of the H-H model.

This frequency corresponds to the proper frequency of the H-H model.",

      "abstract": "The Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) [11], [5] is a popular blind equalization algorithm. A common device used in demonstrating the convergence properties of CMA is the assumption that the source sequence is iid (independent, identically distributed). Recent results in the literature show that a finite length fractionally-spaced equalizer allows for perfect equalization of moving average channels (under certain channel conditions known as zero-forcing criteria). CMA has been shown to converge to such perfectly equalizing settings under an independent, platykurtic source [9],[4]. This paper investigates the effect of the distribution from which an independent source sequence is drawn on the CMA error surface and stationary points in the perfectly-equalizable fractionally-sampled equalizer case. Results include symbolic identification of all stationary points, as well as the eigenvalues and eigenvectors associated with their Hessian matrix. Results show quantitatively the loss of error surface curvature (in both direction and magnitude) at all stationary points. Simulations included demonstrate the affect this has on convergence speed.",

Such Implementations are often faster and/or smaller than all digital Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT's), but suffer from accuracy limitations imposed by the analog devices. In this paper, we present a nested algorithm that permits excess bandwidth of the analog device to be exploited in order to compute the DFT more accurately. The nested structure can be realized with a single analog device, and can be trained to the errors associated with the device. Algorithm performance is verified through computer simulations in which DFT accuracy is limited due to fixed tap weight errors in the FIR filter portion of the chirp Ztransform.",

Conventionally, solving an eigensystem will require 0(N ) times with sequential machine; or 0(N ) time with 0(N) processing units. By exploring the Toeplitz structure and adopting a Rayleigh quotient iteration, the TES can solve for the desired minimum eigenvalue in 0(KN) time with N processors and K iterations. The development of TES offers a fast algorithm to implement the Pisarenko's high resolution spectral estimation technique.",

      "abstract": "Mechanisms of the myogenic response have not been completely established. We hypothesize that transmural fluid filtration from plasma across smooth muscle cells and into the surrounding interstitium helps regulate arteriolar myogenic tone. Arteriolar diameters in the rat mesentery were monitored prior to and following vascular occlusion with a glass micropipette. Arteriolar occlusion not only gave an increase in hydrostatic pressure that initiated a myogenic response upstream of the pipette, but also allowed measurement of fluid filtration rate by monitoring the movement of vascular red blood cells. A statistically significant correlation existed between basal myogenic tone and fluid filtration. Additionally, the myogenic response was attenuated when an osmotic solution of albumin and ficoll was infused into the bloodstream to decrease fluid filtration. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that shear stress on arteriolar smooth muscle, induced by transmural fluid filtration, is a contributing factor that helps control myogenic tone.",

      "abstract": "Exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress stimulates NO production by phosphorylating eNOS at Ser1179 in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)- and PKA-dependent mechanisms. The eNOS contains additional potential phosphorylation sites including Ser116, Thr497 and Ser635. Here, we studied phosphorylation of these potential sites in response to shear stress, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 8-Br-cAMP in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). All three stimuli induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser635 that was consistently slower than that at Ser1179. The Thr497 was rapidly dephosphorylated by 8-Br-cAMP, but not by shear and VEGF. None of the stimuli phosphorylated the Ser116. While shear-dependent phosphorylation of Ser635 was not affected by PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002, it was blocked by either treating cells with a PKA inhibitor H89 or infecting with an adenoviral vector expressing PKA inhibitor (PKI). These results suggest that shear stimulates at least two independent signaling pathways regulating eNOS: one that activates a PI3K-dependent PKA pathway and the other that activates a PI3K-independent PKA pathway. In summary, these studies suggest an essential role of PKA in regulation of eNOS and endothelial cell biology in response to shear stress.",

      "abstract": "A well known problem in loudspeaker equalization is that mixed phase design of the inverse filter causes residual \"pre-ringings\" in the equalized system, due to the spatial variability of loudspeaker-room transfer functions. A common strategy for robust and perceptually acceptable equalization is therefore to use minimum phase filters only. In this paper, a method for cautious mixed phase equalization is proposed. By analysis of a set of room transfer functions, it is concluded that some non-minimum phase zeros are insensitive to receiver position, and can therefore be robustly inverted. The method improves upon a minimum phase equalization by extending the minimum phase model with a robustly invertible all pass link. Validation measurements show that the time-domain aspect of equalization is improved throughout the spatial region of interest, while pre-ringings are kept at a very low and prespecified level.",

The model is specified hierarchically within the Bayesian paradigm. At the lowest level of the hierarchy, a Gibbs distribution is used to specify a probability distribution on all the possible partitions of the utterance. The number of partitioning elements which are phonemes is not specified a priori. At higher level in the hierarchical specification, random variables representing phoneme durations and acoustic vector values are associated with each phoneme and frame. Estimation of the posterior distribution is done using Gibbs sampler scheme.",

Wavelet Markov models explicitly include dependence across scale, which allows us to characterize highly structured clutter. Since structured clutter is a common cause of false alarms in modern ATR systems, these models give us the ability to analyze and predict false alarm rates and other ATR performance characteristics. These predictions can lead to adaptive ATR systems which automatically adjust to local clutter conditions.",

We will introduce a formalization of the notion of the speaker's references in a context, and a semantical storage mechanism for resolving the quantificational and de re/de dicto scope ambiguities. In Montague Grammar (PTQ) all verbs are initially treated as intensional, and then the extensional translations, whenever they exist, are derived from the intensional ones by the use of meaning postulates. Such a treatment of the extensional verbs, besides of being counterintuitive, increases dramatically the complexity of the computations of the semantical representations of the sentences, which exponentially propagates to the text processing. The paper introduces a lexicalized situation semantics treatment of the quantifiers and the intensional verbs. The approach is illustrated by a grammar, which uses a semantical storage. Primarily, the semantic storage targets the anaphoric and quantificational relations and related scope ambiguities, but it also facilitates the represention of the de re/de dicto \"reading\" capacities of the intensional verbs. The grammar accounts for the difference between extensional and intensional verbs by the means of appropriateness conditions for filling the semantical argument roles of the relations denoted by the verbs. The semantical rules for the verb phrases result in type-driven calculations triggered by discourse information.",

Mambo is driven by conditional independence relations between the variables instead of the minimum support restrictions of algorithms like Apriori. We argue that making use of conditional independencies is an intuitively appealing way to restrict the set of association rules considered. Since we only have a finite sample from the probability distribution of interest, we have to deal with uncertainty concerning the conditional independencies present. Bayesian methods are used to quantify this uncertainty, and the posterior probabilities of conditional independence relations are estimated with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. We analyse an insurance data set with Mambo and illustrate the differences in results compared to Apriori.",

The CA-JML algorithm, presented here, offers dramatic angle estimation improvement in environments that contain exploitable interference. The performance improvement is equivalent to the removal of the interferers from the environment. The complexity of the algorithm, however, is comparable to MUSIC. Even when structured interferers are not present, the CA-JML algorithm can reduce the angle error bias exhibited in MUSIC in challenging environments. The CA-JML algorithm also admits a simple relaxation technique as each emitter is localized, which reduces the probability of angle estimation error due to the presence of ambiguous peaks in the angle objective function.",

In this approach, local constraints are captured via n-gram language modeling, while global constraints are taken into account through the use of latent semantic analysis. The performance of the resulting multi-span language models, as measured by perplexity, has been shown to compare favorably with the corresponding n-gram performance. This paper reports on actual speech recognition experiments, and shows that word error rate is also substantially reduced. On a subset of the Wall Street Journal speaker-independent, 20,000-word vocabulary, continuous speech task, the multi-span framework resulted in a reduction in average word error rate of up to 17%.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a new spoken word recognition approach based on the topdown phoneme segmentation. Fourteen phoneme recognition functions are introduced to deal with various coarticulation. 1 :. This new approach has two advantages. First, a precise phoneme recognition can be achieved because of the phoneme level topdown verification. Second, only phoneme symbol sequences are required for the vocabulary knowledge source, because the coarticulation knowledge is included in phoneme level knowledge sources. Experimental recognition results for 100 city names uttered by 50 speakers indicate that the phoneme concatenations showing strong coarticulation must be segmented as a unit to achieve a high recognition rate.",

      "abstract": "The increased popularity of multimedia applications places a great demand on efficient data storage and transmission techniques. Network communication, especially over a wireless network, can easily be intercepted and must be protected from eavesdroppers. Unfortunately, encryption and decryption are slow, and it is often difficult, if not impossible, to carry out real-time secure image and video communication and processing. Methods have been proposed to combine compression and encryption together to reduce the overall processing time, but they are either insecure or too computationally intensive. We propose a novel solution called partial encryption, in which a secure encryption algorithm is used to encrypt only part of the compressed data. Partial encryption is applied to several image and video compression algorithms in this paper. Only 1327% of the output from quadtree compression algorithms is encrypted for typical images, and less than 2% is encrypted for 512X512 images compressed by the set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) algorithm. The results are similar for video compression, resulting in a significant reduction in encryption and decryption time. The proposed partial encryption schemes are fast, secure, and do not reduce the compression performance of the underlying compression algorithm.",

Its main features are architectural support for multithreading, interprocessor communication based on virtual channels and exploitation of instruction level parallelism within each processing cell of the array. Up to four threads can be executed in an interleaved fashion on one processor array. Physical implementation details of the processor network topology are hidden from programmer, since instructions used for interprocessor communication operate on virtual channels. The same algorithm can thus be executed unchanged on multiple physically implemented interconnection network topologies ranging from linear, 2D mesh to hex array. Architecture is optimized to execute algorithms in single precision 32-bit floating-point arithmetic. There are two controllers available, each controlling part of the processing array. This feature is helpful in implementing linear algebra algorithms which usually have processing cells with different functionalities within single array.",

More recently, the task of inferring cross-category relationship patterns among retail assortments is gaining attraction due to its promotional potential within recommender systems used in online environments. Collaborative Filtering algorithms are frequently used in such settings for the prediction of choices, preferences and/or ratings of online users. The fundamental assumption of such algorithms resides in the available similarity information between a specific active user and a database of all other users. We study the effects of different similarity measures, available data points per user and the number of items to be recommended on the relative predictive performance in an experiment using market basket data collected from a grocery retailer. Using various measures for evaluation of the predictive ability, we derive some clues to the proper parameterization of such systems.",

However, current data quantization schemes do not take into account the amplitude-ordered data and therefore, may not perform optimally. In this paper, we consider the problem of determining optimum quantizers for ordered data. Two different design approaches are presented, and performance characteristics of quantizers obtained using the two approaches are given.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes a new representation for people and animals, called a body plan. The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from constraints on color, texture, shape, and geometrical relations. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. Body plans are well adapted to segmentation and recognition in complex environments, such as the huge libraries of digitized images now becoming widely available. Two specific applications of body plans are presented: an algorithm that determines whether an image depicts a scantily clad human and an algorithm that learns and uses a body plan to find pictures of horses. Both algorithms demonstrate excellent performance on large, poorly controlled input data.",

The asymptotic solution is not only rigorously valid for systems with large array sizes, but it also produces highly accurate ergodic results for systems with only a few antenna elements at each transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, with the asymptotic solution, we provide an efficient iterative water-filling algorithm to determine the optimum transmit signal covariance matrices when only the slow-varying channel spatial covariance information is available.",

Two sets are considered: the set of stable filters and the set of filters which minimize the mean square prediction error in an environment where the statistics of the observed data are unknown. These two sets are described analytically and the problem of obtaining a feasible LPC filter is addressed. Experimental results are also presented",

For English, one monolingual run using only fields based on fully automatic transcription (the required condition) and one (otherwise identical) cross-language run using French queries were officially scored. Three contrastive runs in which manually generated metadata fields in the English collection were indexed were also officially scored to explore the applicability of recently developed \"meaning matching\" approaches to cross-language retrieval of manually indexed interviews. Statistical translation models trained on European Parliament proceedings were found to be poorly matched to this task, yielding 38% and 44% of monolingual mean average precision for indexing based on automatic transcription and manually generated metadata, respectively. Weighted use of alternative translations yielded an apparent (but not statistically significant) 7% improvement over one-best translation when bi-directional meaning matching techniques were employed. Results for Czech were not informative in this first year of that task, perhaps because no accommodations were made for the unique characteristics of Czech morphology.",

The tracked objects are humans, which are not rigid bodies. As such shape deformations of the objects must be allowed. For each frame, the decision has to be made which pixels belong to an object, and which do not. The integration of detection and tracking is done using a likelihood-based framework. This way the classification of pixels between background and object can be based on comparing likelihoods rather then separate thresholds. A demonstration of the proposed algorithm will be given.",

The output of this algorithm, which we call CiteRank, is interpreted as approximate traffic to individual publications in a simple model of how researchers find new information. We develop an analytical understanding of traffic flow in terms of an RPA-like model and optimize parameters of our algorithm to achieve the best performance. The results are compared for two rather different citation networks: all American Physical Society publications and the set of high-energy physics theory (hep-th) preprints. Despite major differences between these two networks, we find that their optimal parameters for the CiteRank algorithm are remarkably similar.",

First, the structure of the ANC system adopting the proposed method is discussed. Second, the update equations of the system modules employing the LMS algorithm are derived. Next, the off-line initialization procedures of the system modules together with the update equations are described. Computer simulations illustrate the performance of the feedforward multiplepoint ANC system adopting the proposed method. Simulation results show that the system can achieve superb low-frequency noise reduction and the reconvergence of the system error is guaranteed even when changes are encountered into the primary and secondary paths.",

Nevertheless, the use of semi-continuous HMMs in large vocabulary speech recognition systems has declined considerably in recent years. A significant factor that has contributed this is that systems that use semi-continuous HMMs cannot be easily adapted to new acoustic (environmental or speaker) conditions. While maximum likelihood (ML) adaptation techniques have been very successful for continuous density HMMs, these have not worked to a usable degree for semi-continuous HMMs. This paper presents a new framework for supervised and unsupervised ML adaptation of semi-continuous HMMs, built upon the paradigm of probabilistic latent semantic analysis. Experiments with a specific implementation developed under this framework demonstrate its effectiveness.",

Second, we develop a modified filter design applicable to nonzero mean noise; this latter case occurs in many applications where the magnitude image is used for classification.

Key considerations in enterprise information management are: first, associating business value with information; second, appropriately retaining information that is required by law; and third, cost-effectively dealing with vast amount of incoming information. This talk will be an exploration of the dimensions of business value, particularly time and expectedness. System architecture considerations, especially the tradeoff between storage and processing, will be described. Key ideas in system design will be summarized, for addressing the most important aspects of each lifecycle stage.",

The iteration equation consists of a prediction part which is based on a noncausal image model description and an innovation part which is weighted by a gain factor. The gain is computed using a linear MSE optimization procedure and is updated at each step of the iteration. This image restoration scheme can be interpreted as an iterative procedure with a statistical constraint on the image data.",

There are, however, no established methods to make use of WWW as a large image database. In this paper, we describe an automatic image-gathering system from WWW, in which we use both keywords and image features. By exploiting some existing keyword-based search engines and selecting images by their image features, our system obtains, with high accuracy, images that are strongly related to query keywords. This system has been implemented on a parallel PC cluster, which enables us to gather more than one hundred images from WWW in about one minute.",

The algorithm iteratively prunes state transitions from a large general HMM topology and selects a topology based on a likelihood criterion and a heuristic evaluation of complexity. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to estimate the dynamic structure of human body motion data from a repetitive lifting task. The estimated topology for low back pain patients was different from the topology for a control subject group. The body motions of patients tend not to change over the task, but the body motions of control subjects change systematically.",

By using a less informative hidden-data space and a sequential parameter-update scheme, a SAGE-based algorithm is derived for which convergence of the likelihood is demonstrated to be significantly faster than that of an EM-based algorithm that has been previously proposed. In addition, the SAGE procedure is shown to easily accommodate penalty functions, and a SAGE-based algorithm is derived and demonstrated for forming PML estimates with a quadratic smoothness penalty.",

      "abstract": "A unitary approach for locally apertured orientation analysis of 2D and 3D scalar images is proposed. The size of the local aperture (the scale) needed for the orientation representation induces in general a loss of spatial acuity, or blur. Our construction permits a compensation of the blur by a reconstruction procedure. For this purpose, a special scale-dependent orientation bundle (map of the visual space into a function of both position and orientation) is built from the local Gaussian-derivatives jet of a scalar image. In this construction there is an invertible relation between the orientation bundle and the original image in the space domain. This invertible transformation is used to regain the original acuity in the spatial domain after analyzing orientation features at any given scale. This type of orientation \"encoding\" might contribute to understand both the role of orientation columns and the hyper-acuity phenomenon in biological visual systems. The approach turns out to be highly effective for the detection of elongated structures and for removal of elongated artifacts in 2D images. The results from the detection task can be enhanced by applying an anisotropic diffusion of the orientation field and thus closing missing contour segments.",

Compared to the separable solution, proposed by Malvar [1], the new realization of 2-D ELT has reduced arithmetic complexity. Computational savings are achieved because scaling and inverse scaling of butterfly matrices, suggested by Malvar for 1-D case, are, after some modifications of the basic separable algorithm, extended to 2-D case. The new implementation has the same frequency response as Malvar's",

The estimation is carried out on the wavelet coefficients using a coarse-to-fine cross-scale search. A prior is specified for the location of the extremum at a given scale based on a location estimate at a coarser scale and a likelihood function is specified based on a rank-ordered version of the wavelet coefficients, leading to a MAP estimate at the given scale. This then becomes the location parameter for the prior at the next finer scale in a scale-recursive MAP estimation scheme.

      "abstract": "This paper considers the problem of automatic classification of newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) data in order to diagnose for seizure. It is shown that good detection performance of seizure EEG is possible using a methodology based on a model for the generation of the EEG. This model is derived from the histology and biophysics of a localised portion of the brain and is thus physically motivated. The model based detection scheme is first presented and used to detect seizure in real newborn EEG data. These results are then compared with an alternative classification approach known as the quadratic detection filter (QDF). It is shown that the model based scheme is far superior to the QDF since it is not adversely affected by the variability (or non-stationarity) of EEG data, which hin- ders the performance of most traditional EEG classifiers (such as the QDF).",

      "abstract": "Clusters of fine, granular microcalcifications in mammograms may be an early sign of disease. Individual grains are difficult to detect and segment due to size and shape variability and because the background mammogram texture is typically inhomogeneous. We develop a two-stage method based on wavelet transforms for detecting and segmenting calcifications. The first stage is based on an undecimated wavelet transform, which is simply the conventional filter bank implementation without downsampling, so that the low-low (LL), low-high (LH), high-low (HL), and high-high (HH) sub-bands remain at full size. Detection takes place in HH and the combination LH+HL. Four octaves are computed with two inter-octave voices for finer scale resolution. By appropriate selection of the wavelet basis the detection of microcalcifications in the relevant size range can be nearly optimized. In fact, the filters which transform the input image into HH and LH+HL are closely related to prewhitening matched filters for detecting Gaussian objects (idealized microcalcifications) in two common forms of Markov (background) noise. The second stage is designed to overcome the limitations of the simplistic Gaussian assumption and provides an accurate segmentation of calcification boundaries. Detected pixel sites in HH and LH+HL are dilated then weighted before computing the inverse wavelet transform. Individual microcalcifications are greatly enhanced in the output image, to the point where straightforward thresholding can be applied to segment them. FROC curves are computed from tests using a freely distributed database of digitized mammograms.",

The HMMs are widely-used statistical models to characterize the sequence of speech spectra and have successfully been applied to speech recognition systems. From these facts, it is considered that the HMM is useful for modeling pitch patterns of speech. However, we cannot apply the conventional discrete or continuous HMMs to pitch pattern modeling since the observation sequence of pitch pattern is composed of one-dimensional continuous values and a discrete symbol which represents \"unvoiced\". MSD-HMM includes discrete HMM and continuous mixture HMM as special cases, and further can model the sequence of observation vectors with variable dimension including zero-dimensional observations, i.e., discrete symbols. As a result, MSD-HMMs can model pitch patterns without heuristic assumption. We derive a reestimation algorithm for the extended HMM and show that it can find a critical point of the likelihood function.",

      "abstract": "Evolution strategies (ES)are efficient optimization methods for continuous problems. However, many combinatorial optimization methods can not be represented by using continuous representations. The development of the network random key representation which represents trees by using real numbers allows one to use ES for combinatorial tree problems. In this paper we apply ES to tree problems using the network random key representation. We examine whether existing recommendations regarding optimal parameter settings for ES, which were developed for the easy sphere and corridor model, are also valid for the easy one-max tree problem. The results show that the 1/5-success rule for the (1+1)-ES results in low performance because the standard deviation is continuously reduced and we get early convergence. However, for the (ľ+?)-ES and the (ľ, ?)-ES the recommendations from the literature are confirmed for the parameters of mutation ?1 and ?2 and the ratio ľ/?. This paper illustrates how existing theory about ES is helpful in finding good parameter settings for new problems like the one-max tree problem.",

      "abstract": "A fundamental problem in auditory and speech processing is the segregation of speech from concurrent sounds. This problem has been a focus of study in computational auditory scene analysis (CASA), and it has also been recently investigated from the perspective of blind source separation. Using a standard corpus of voiced speech mixed with interfering sounds, we report a comparison between CASA and blind source separation techniques, which have been developed independently. Our comparison reveals that they perform well under very different conditions. A number of conclusions are drawn with respect to their relative strengths and weaknesses in speech segregation applications as well as in modeling auditory function.",

      "abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms and, in particular, Genetic Programming (GP) are increasingly being applied to the problem of evolving term-weighting schemes in Information Retrieval (IR). One fundamental problem with the solutions generated by these stochastic processes is that they are often difficult to analyse. A number of questions regarding these evolved term-weighting schemes remain unanswered. One interesting question is; do different runs of the GP process bring us to similar points in the solution space? This paper deals with determining a number of measures of the distance between the ranked lists (phenotype) returned by different term-weighting schemes. Using these distance measures, we develop trees that show the phenotypic distance between these term-weighting schemes. This framework gives us a representation of where these evolved solutions lie in the solution space. Finally, we evolve several global term-weighting schemes and show that this framework is indeed useful for determining the relative closeness of these schemes and for determining the expected performance on general test data.",

K-tree supports on-line dynamic tree construction. The properties of the resulting search tree and clustering codebook are comparable to that of codebooks obtained by TSVQ, the commonly used recursive k-means algorithm for constructing vector quantization search trees. The K-tree algorithm scales up to larger data sets than TSVQ, produces codebooks with somewhat higher distortion rates, but facilitates greater control over the properties of the resulting codebooks. We demonstrate the properties and performance of K-tree and compare it with TSVQ and with k-means.",

Traditionally, the resolution of the phase ambiguity and the filtering stages were performed separately, with the filter formulated on the basis that the phase ambiguity is correctly resolved. Should the pre-processing stage not resolve the ambiguity correctly, erroneous results may occur. In response, a unified solution is proposed in which the ambiguity resolution and filtering processes are combined under a Gaussian Sum Filtering (GSF) framework. The GSF naturally accounts for the measurement ambiguity by generating multi-modal probability densities, which leads to a probabilistic interpretation of the attitude estimates. Simulations axe performed to illustrate the effectiveness and functionality of the proposed solution.",

Even with error rates of around 40%, the effectiveness of an IR system falls less than 10%. The paper hypothesizes that this robust behavior is the result of repetition of important words in the textmeaning that losing one or two occurrences is not cripplingand the result of additional related words providing a greater contextmeaning that those words will match even if the seemingly critical word is misrecognized. This hypothesis is supported by examples from TREC's SDR track, the TDT evaluation, and some work showing the impact of recognition errors on spoken queries.",

This paper presents an ontology model that facilitates formal ontological analysis, by providing a set of metaproperties which characterise the behaviour of concept properties in a concept definition, while providing a richer semantics of the concept. We describe concepts in terms of their attributes (characterising features) and we also describe the role played by these features in the concept definition, whether they are prototypical or exceptional, whether they are permitted to change over time, and if so, how often this happens, how likely is a concept to show these features, etc. We show that these metaproperties can support a methodology, OntoClean [44] that uses formal ontological analysis to build cleaner taxonomies (which are thus more sharable). The set of metaproperties for attributes we propose can be used to guide in determining which metaproperties for concepts hold for an ontology and therefore can support the use OntoClean.",

For a large size transform, the speed of this process is often too slow for real-time applications. In this paper we propose a new parallel 2-D FFT architecture that can compute a 2-D Fourier Transform in 0(VNNIogV\"Ny time, a speedup of 0(VN) over conventional row-column approaches. Even higher speedups can be achieved with the use of larger radix sizes. A result of these new techniques is a processor speedup of 27 for a 256 x 256 2-D FFT with only a fivefold increase in hardware.",

      "abstract": "This paper is a self-contained presentation of a method for combining several belief functions on a common frame that is different from a mere application of Dempster's rule. All the necessary results and their proofs are presented in the paper. It begins with a review and explanation of concepts related to the notion of non-normalized mass-function, or gem-function, introduced by P. Smets under the name basic belief assignment [1,6]. Then the link with Dempster's rule of combination is established. Several results in relation with the notion of Dempster specialization matrix are proved for the first time [2]. Based on these results, the method is then presented and a small application is considered.",

Surgical simulation is a technique whereby a user interacts, through virtual surgical tools, with an anatomical model endowed with realistic constitutive properties.

This paper suggests a minimally supervised procedure for extracting from CT and MR scans, co-registered in a distortion-tolerant manner, a highly descriptive classification of tissues which exploits global contiguity and prior assumptions about spatial extent and embedded structure, in order to generate a patient-specific anatomical model.",

The results of the tests show that the ADPCM coding technique can be an efficient mean to transmit wideband speech signals. The quality of the A.D.P.C.M(V) coded speech compares well with that obtained with subbands coding technique. The quality of the transmitted speech, though slightly worse than \"high fidelity speech\", could be sufficient for communications systems such as audio or video conferencing systems, commentary links for broadcasting...",

However, problems such as missing edges, weak edges due to thresholding, derivatives not existing and false edge generation, are some of the consequences. We adopt a new formalism: Edges are singularities of the mathematically smoothest function possible - the complex analytic function. We embed a real image into the real part of an analytic function. After solving the conjugate harmonic problem, edges in discrete images are identified from the imaginary part. The analytic function model is inherently two-dimensional and an invariant measure. Comparisons are made with other standard edge detection methods. We outline issues that need to be considered for establishing analytic functions for edge detection.",

      "abstract": "A complex random vector is called improper if it is correlated with its complex conjugate. In this paper, we present a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for impropriety. This test is compelling because it displays the right invariances: The proposed GLR is invariant to linear transformations on the data, including rotation and scaling, just as propriety is preserved by linear transformations. Because canonical correlations make up a complete, or maximal, set of invariants for the Hermitian and complementary covariance matrices under linear transformations, the GLR can be shown to be a function of the squared canonical correlations between the data and its complex conjugate. This validates our intuition that the internal coordinate system should not matter for this hypothesis test.",

Various refinements have been proposed, including actively changing the window shape during processing [1, 2, 3] and multi-resolution analysis [4]. Here we use the multi-scale tree representation of the image to generate window shapes that are well matched to image objects. We use the structure of the tree to refine our disparity search, creating a disparity tree. This tree is a close representation of the objects in the scene, and is a step towards creating a symbolic representation of objects within a scene. We find the new method has particularly good performance in regions of low texture: operating conditions that cause the conventional methods to fail.",

      "abstract": "We consider the identification of systems which are both time-varying and nonlinear. This class of systems is more likely to be encountered in practice, but is often avoided due to the difficulties that axise in modelling and estimation. We attempt to address this problem by considering a new time-varying nonlineax model, the time-varying Hammerstein model, which effectively characterises time-variation and nonlinearity in a simple manner. Using this model we formulate a procedure to find least-squares estimates of the coefficients. The model is general and can be used when little is known about the time-variation of the system. In addition, we do not require that the input is stationary or Gaussian. Finally, an application to automobile knock modelling is presented, where a time-varying nonlinear model is seen to more accurately characterise the system than a time-varying linear one.",

      "abstract": "The paper discusses a scheme based on Kalman-Bucy filters for the assimilation of satellite data in equatorial beta plane ocean circulation models. The state equation of the Kalman-Bucy filter is obtained by decoupling the non-linearities from the Navier-Stokes equations by assuming an inviscid isentropic shallow water motion. Direct application of the Kalman-Bucy filter leads to a computationally intensive algorithm which precludes its application to meaningful sized domains. By imposing a Gauss Markov random field (GMRF) structure on the error covariance matrix, we obtain an efficient recursive algorithm, capable of estimating the velocity fields and the sea surface height.",

This mapping can be used in the detection and parameter estimation of signals unknown embedded in noise. It is shown that this mapping comes directly from the application of the matched filter theory. In particular, the method can be applied to multi-components signals, since it reduces considerably the effect of the cross terms, produced by the WVD, on the signal parameters estimate.",

Further, [2] provides a computationally efficient algorithm to solve the formulation of the problem proposed in [1]. In this paper, we examine an alternative method for applying an optimal low rank transform, within the framework derived in [1], to convert an overdetermined, full rank system into a low rank system. In addition, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for the implementation of our method, using the DCT as the unitary transformation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm via simulation in an acoustic echo canceller application, and show that the performance of our method is superior to existing low rank methods, NLMS and affine projection.",

A model that includes all relevant hot clutter parameters such as spatial delay, doppler, and carrier phase angle is developed. Subbanding using DFT or the wavelet transform is implemented prior to adaptive processing and tap delay filtering. A corapArison between the two subbanding techniques using the cancellation ratio as a performance measure is presented. The effects of the number of tap delays, jamming angle of arrival, doppler spread, and jammer relative bandwidth on the performance of an adaptive array are examined.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates (a) the extent to which L2 learners use phonetic information from visual cues to improve the perception of a novel phonemic contrast following a course of intensive perceptual training, and (b) the impact of perceptual training on pronunciation. 62 Japanese learners of English were initially tested on their perception of the /l/-/r/ contrast in audio, visual and audiovisual modalities, and then undertook ten sessions of intensive training, before being tested again. Eighteen were trained using auditory stimuli, 25 using natural audiovisual stimuli and 19 using audiovisual stimuli combining a synthetic face with natural speech. All three groups of learners showed a significant benefit of training but learners with audiovisual training did not show greater improvement than listeners with auditory training. The 'Auditory-training' group improved their auditory perception of the sounds to a greater extent than the AV-training groups, and the AV (natural face) trainees improved their sensitivity to visual cues to a greater extent than those trained with auditory or AV (synthetic face) stimuli. The learners' pronunciation of /l/-/r/ consonants improved significantly following perceptual training, with a greater improvement seen for those trained audiovisually with natural stimuli.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for solving the correspondence problem in 3D shape reconstruction using a Structured Light System (SLS) which projects a grid of laser rays. In this particular case, the correspondence problem amounts to matching up the laser rays and the illuminated spots. We propose a strategy for obtaining Configurations Of the System COS- (i.e. the positions of the camera, the laser projector and the measuring scene) that allow to perform an unambiguous direct correspondence. Experimental results demonstrate that our methodology provides our SLS with high capabilities, which permits an efficient use in dynamic applications.",

      "abstract": "A computational model to map from articulatory data to an articulatory-phonetic representation is examined in this paper. The approach uses positional values tracked by X-ray microbeam of two lip pellets and four tongue pellets nonlinearly transformed to a new Cartesian space in which the new x and y values represent the distance of the pellets going back along the opposing vocal tract wall and the distance perpendicular to the tract wall. The transformed articulatory data, as well as the simultaneously recorded electroglottograph data, then serve as the input representation for the computational model that makes use of temporal decomposition to model multichannel trajectories. Temporal decomposition constructs a set of target functions from data-derived basis functions using a form of adaptive Gauss-Seidel iteration. The resultant target functions, in conjunction with the weights for each basis function, are then used to derive the articulatorv-phonetic representation called a gestural score. This method is applied to the task of estimating the gestural score for various CVC syllables embedded in frame sentences in the stimulus set. To determine the adequacy of the derived gestural scores, two evaluations were performed: a perception test and a classification test using an automatic recognizer based on a neural network model. High recognition rates from both the perceptual experiments and the automatic recognizers support the hypothesis that sufficient information is available in the resultant gestural scores to allow accurate identification of the phonetic elements.",

      "abstract": "The standard format for video acquisition, transmission and presentation uses an interlaced scanning technique. On the other hand, for digital video services, the progressive format is more desirable in many situations, and different resolutions of the signal are required. The interlaced scan is based on a tight concatenation of vertical and temporal sampling effects. This paper introduces the technique of motion-compensated vertical filters within pairs of fields to solve the problem of sampling rate conversion between interlaced and progressive raster. It is shown that the motion-compensated vertical filter is a polyphase realization of a factor-2 up- or downsampling filterbank, with polyphase shift controlled by motion parameters. Possible applications are down- and up-conversion between progressive and interlaced formats, and multiresolution representation of video data within a spatio-temporal subband or wavelet framework.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, a large effort has gone into researching the use of FPGA devices for co-processing. Much of the emphasis of this work has been in the area of design entry tools. As FPGA co-processing moves into the mainstream, tools to support the complete design and implementation process are being more actively investigated. In particular, the ability to perform integrated hardware / software co-debug in these environments is of interest. One key element of FPGA co-processing is system synchronization and clock control. Today, some commercially available FPGA co-processing systems contain simple clock control such as single- and multi-stepping. Others have no clock control whatsoever, offering only a free-running system clock. In this paper a set of Reconfigurable Hardware Breakpoint cores is described. These cores are used to provide the control necessary for co-debug in FPGA co-processing systems and can be used to trace the flow of a circuit at run-time or control its operation. Reconfigurable hardware breakpoint cores are independent of circuit board clock implementation and are shipped as part of the JBits Software Development Kit as Run-Time Parameterizable (RTP) Cores.",

      "abstract": "Selecting good speech units and building precise acoustic models on these units are basic problems for HMM speech recognition system. In this paper, we review some distinguished phonetic features of Chinese language and show how these features could be considered for getting better solution of speech units selecting and acoustic models building. The initials and finals are suggested to be the recognition units. Several experiments have been carried out to find those proper acoustic models which can represent the co-articulation among initials and finals more accurately and give higher recognition rate. Results of recognition error rate under different acoustic models are given and some comparisons are made. Experiments show that not only the intra-syllable context-dependent acoustic models but also the inter-syllable acoustic models are necessary for reducing recognition error rate of word and continuous speech recognition. Experiments also show the tone-pattem information is important for accurate syllable recognition.",

The purpose of this elicitation is rapid development of NLP systems. The approach is described on the example of the syntax module of the Boas knowledge elicitation system for a quick ramp up of a standard transfer-based machine translation system from L into English. The preparation of knowledge for the MT system is carried out into two stages; the acquisition of descriptive knowledge about L and using the descriptive knowledge to derive operational knowledge for the system. Boas guides the acquisition process using data-driven, expectation-driven and goal-driven methodologies.",

      "abstract": "Physical evidence points to the importance of a concept called \"modulation frequency.\" This dimension exists jointly with standard Fourier or acoustic frequency. Thus, akin to other time-varying analysis, we seek a two-dimensional representation, the \"modulation spectrum,\" where the first dimension is the well-known acoustic frequency and the second dimension is modulation frequency. We describe some deficiencies in previous discussions of this concept, and then address those deficiencies via a homomorphic approach. We also reduce previous difficulties in homomorphic demultiplication by integrating this processing into modulation spectra and, in particular, show how assumption of analytic and relatively narrowband sub-bands allows more accurate and practical use of homomorphic demultiplication. Lastly, we show how an unambiguous demultiplication concept is only consistent with complex modulator envelopes. The assumption of complex envelopes is necessary for accurate modulation spectral analysis and filtering.",

      "abstract": "Tagged magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been shown to be a useful means for non-invasive measurement of the deformation of the left ventricle (LV) during the cardiac cycle. One can estimate a dense displacement field based on the tag line movements and use it to compute myocardial measures such as strain. Existing methods require that the boundaries of the LV be known before the displacement field is estimated, which results in a time-consuming process since user intervention is needed for the estimation of the boundaries. In this paper, vie propose a method that jointly estimates the LV boundaries and displacement field without user-intervention. We model the displacement field as a compound Gauss-Markov random field (CGMRF) which is parameterized by two closed and smooth contours. A partial-optimal solution is sought by iteratively updating the displacement field, the contours and the parameters. Experimental results on both simulated vector image and in vivo human data show that our method is capable of automatically tracking the contours and reconstructing displacement field with a decent accuracy.",

To test our algorithm, which allows for various gradations of preciseness in pointing, subjects performed an object identification task in a strict experimental setting. 20 subjects participated and were instructed to always use a pointing gesture (they were led to believe they were testing a new kind of 'digital pointing device'). The subjects performed their tasks on two distances: close (10 subjects) and at a distance of 2.5 meters (10 subjects). The assumption is that these conditions yield precise and imprecise pointing gestures respectively. In addition we varied the 'type' of target objects (geometrical figures versus pictures of persons). This study resulted in a corpus of 600 multimodal referring expressions. A statistical analysis (ANOVA) revealed a main effect of distance (subjects adapt their language to the kind of pointing gesture) and also a main effect of target (persons are more difficult to describe than objects). The advantages and disadvantages of this evaluation method are discussed.",

      "abstract": "IDS (Intrusion Detection System) plays a vital role in network security in that it monitors system activities to identity unauthorized use, misuse or abuse of computer and network system. For the simulation of IDS a model has been constructed based on the DEVS (Discrete EVent system Specification) formalism. With this model we can simulate whether the intrusion detection, which is a core function of IDS, is effectively done under various different conditions. As intrusions become more sophisticated, it is beyond the scope of any one IDS to deal with them. Thus we placed multiple IDS agents in the network where the information helpful for detecting the intrusions is shared among these agents to cope effectively with attackers. Each agent cooperates through the BBA (Black Board Architecture) for detecting intrusions. If an agent detects intrusions, it transfers attacker's information to a Firewall. Using this mechanism attacker's packets detected by IDS can be prevented from damaging the network.",

      "abstract": "A waveform measure for predicting the degradation of speech recognition performance due to noise contamination is developed. The merits of the proposed measure over using conventional SNR are that 1) the measure does not require original clean signal as a reference signal, 2) the measure takes spectral shape of the noise into account and, 3) the measure can predict recognition performance directly. The basic idea of the measure is to utilize dynamic range of the sub-band signals as estimate of SNR and, predicting degradation of recognition performance by taking a product of the recognition accuracy of each sub-band. The proposed measure is tested through experimental evaluation using white gaussian and human speech like (HSL) noises. In the experiment, the correlation between the predicted and the actual recognition accuracies are 0.96 and 0.99 for white and HSL nose respectively. From the results, the effectiveness of the proposed measure is confirmed.",

This paper presents an on-line test to detect the occurrence of equalisation errors without direct access to the channel input. The test draws on the observation that for linear time-invariant (LTI) channels the relationship between transmitted symbol estimates generated by the equaliser and the noisy channel output can be represented by an underlying linear time-invariant model if and only if no equalisation errors are present in the sequence of transmitted symbol estimates. The presence of equalisation errors renders this relationship time-varying, of which the occurrence is detected by the proposed on-line test using the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm. Simulation studies corroborate the good detection performance of the test.",

The method has been tested using computer simulations and successfully removed most of the artifact. The algorithm converges even in the presence of severe noise.",

The proposed procedure is an extension of our automatic data-driven methodology presented in [1], to model both fundamental frequency and segmental duration.

      "abstract": "We illustrate how high-level knowledge from the musical domain may be integrated with sophisticated signal processing algorithms within a system for separating possibly overlapping partial frequency components from polyphonic music. Musical knowledge utilized in our system is in the form of constraints on the time-frequency behaviors of musical signals such as the frequency locations of notes on the western musical scale and the presence or absence of vibrato in each note. For any given signal scenario, these constraints help in appropriately initializing and adjusting a set of algorithms for constant-Q processing, spectral peak picking, and multihypothesis tracking through Kalman filtering. As demonstrated by the evaluation of our system with a variety of signals containing two simultaneously played violin notes, the application of these algorithms results in the accurate separation of individual partials.",

In this correspondence, a reformulation of the FIR symmetric halfband filter design problem is described, which allows elimination of the constraints on coefficients from the design, thereby facilitating the direct use of the Parks-McClellan design procedure. In this procedure, one needs to use only a single-frequency \"care\"-band for approximation with about one-half the filter order of the halfband filter.",

      "abstract": "We address the identification of nonminimum phase finite impulse response (FIR) systems driven by third-order stationary, colored signals that are not linear processes. First, we discuss modeling the linear part of the bispectrum of a signal, called the \"linear bispectrum.\" We decompose the bispectrum of a signal into two multiplicative factors. The linear bispectrum is defined as the factor of the bispectrum that can exactly be modeled using a third-order white noise driven linear shift-invariant (LSI) system. We show that the desired Fourier-phase and magnitude information about the unknown LSI system is contained in the linear bispectrum of the system output. Thus, we propose representing the linear bispectrum of the output of the unknown LSI system using an ARM A model, where the MA parameters correspond to the unknown FIR system impulse response coefficients, and the AR parameters model the linear bispectrum of the input signal. We then provide an algorithm to identify the MA and AR parameters of this ARMA model. Finally, we elaborate on how the proposed method is different from fitting an ARMA model directly to the bicumulants or the bispectrum of the system output. Application of the proposed method to blur identification is presented.",

An extendable VLSI neural chip has been designed with a silicon area of 4.6x6.8 mm^ in MOSIS 2-|im scalable CMOS process. The mixed analog-digital design techniques are utilized to achieve compact and programmable synapses with gain-adjustable neurons and winner-take-all cells for massively parallel neural computation. Hardware annealing through the control of neurons' gain helps to efficiently search the optimal solutions. Computing of image flow using one 2-nm 72-neuron neural chip can be accelerated by a factor of 187 than a Sun-4/260 workstation. Real-time image flow processing on industrial images is practical using an extended array of VLSI neural chips. Actual examples on moving trucks are presented.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that radar scattering from an illuminated object is often highly aspect dependent. We have developed a multi-aspect target classification technique for SAR imagery that incorporates matching-pursuits feature extraction from each of a sequence of subaperture images, in conjunction with a hidden Markov model that explicitly incorporates the target-sensor motion represented by the image sequence. This approach exploits the aspect dependence of the signal features to facilitate maximum-likelihood identification. We consider SAR imagery containing targets concealed by foliage.",

Finite-state automata operating on artificial descriptions of supra-segmentals and global spectral features isolate syllables in continuous speech. Then a combinational algorithm tracks the formants for the voiced intervals of each syllable, and other algorithms provide a complete structural description of spectral and prosodic features for a spoken sentence. Such a description consists of a string of symbols and numerical attributes and is a representation of speech in terms of perceptually significant primitive forms. It contains all the information required to reconstruct the analyzed sentence with a formant synthesizer; it can be used directly either for emitting or verifying hypotheses at the lexical level of an SUS and for automatically learning phonetic features by grammatical inference.",

We take into account the fact that multiple selling agents may offer the same good with different qualities. In our approach, buying agents learn to avoid the risk of purchasing low quality goods and to maximize their expected value of goods by dynamically maintaining sets of reputable sellers. Selling agents learn to maximize their expected profits by adjusting product prices and by optionally altering the quality of their goods. As detailed in the paper, we believe that our proposed strategy leads to improved performance for buyers and sellers, reduced communication load, and robust systems.",

AR parameters are obtained in the usual way - via the higher-order Yule Walker equations based either on the autocorrelations or the cumulants. Our first method uses q (where q is the MA order) one-dimensional slices of the output cumulant, whereas the second method uses only two such slices to compute the MA parameters. Neither method involves computation of the residual (i.e., AR compensated) time series or polynomial factorization. Extensions to 2-D and multi-channel systems, as well as to time-recursive versions are also developed. Both methods handle Gaussian noise of unknown power spectral densities, at the input as well as at the output. The algorithms are developed for arbitrary cumulant orders.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents the development of a scene interpretation system with imprecise descriptions in a 3D robotics context. The problem of \"scene recognition\" is presented as the matching of images with a priori descriptions given in a high level language. The mission consists in the identification of the position of an object in a scene with a vision system situated at the end of a manipulator. The position of the object is given by the human operator in a pseudo-natural language and the environment is only known through the fuzzy hints of the mission description. The organization of the system and the particular aspects of the scene recognition method are presented. We conclude with the first results of the complete system.",

      "abstract": "BioPAX[1] is a collaborative effort to develop a data exchange format to facilitate integration of biological pathway knowledge. The BioPAX exchange format is currently specified in a combination of English and OWL. In this paper we explore a tension, present in the current BioPAX specification, between representation of records in biological databases and realist representations of biological entities and processes. We propose to reorganize the BioPAX ontology to represent both of these points of view and in the process correct shortcomings in its use of OWL. In doing so we note some issues in using OWL for data exchange. We propose extensions which would both serve accurately model such exchange and help users avoid some common errors when using OWL.",

We also derive expressions for the mean squared error incurred in both the systems while reconstructing individual images of the input class from their samples. For the approximation sampling case we show that the optimal filters are spectral factors of a brickwall-type filter whose support is determined by the sampling lattice. Finally, we present examples of filters in interpolation and approximation sampling cases that are matched to an image class derived from a multispectral image. The performance of these filters is tested in the presence of a quantizer for different bit rates and is compared with that of some standard filters.",

The proposed algorithm consists in two parts: forward lattice and inverse lattice. Collectively, they are referred to as LATIN (Lattice and /nverse Lattice) configuration. While the forward lattice is responsible for acoustic echo cancellation, the inverse lattice is employed in the double-talk (DT) mode only as to undo the distortion of the near-end speech brought about by forward lattice when suppressing the acoustic echo. Assuming M poles and M zeros for the proposed AEC, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is approximately twice the complexity of an M-tap FIR gradient lattice algorithm. Real-time experimentation conducted on ADSP21020 floating-point OSP chip attests to the stability and fast convergence of proposed HR algorithm.",

      "abstract": "Standard speech modeling generally implies the combination of models of the phonemes of the current language with a description of possible pronunciation variants of the vocabulary words. When dealing with foreign accent, this standard native speech modeling is not adequate. In fact many variabilities have to be taken into account as the acoustic realization of the sounds by non-native speakers does not always match with native models and some phonemes may be replaced by others. By introducing models of phonemes estimated from speech data of other languages, and adding extra pronunciation variants through phonological rules, speech recognition performance improvements were achieved on non-native speech. In this study, a selection of the most frequently used variants is proposed, which relies on the frequency of usage of the various models associated to each phoneme on a development set. Although this selection process is rather simple it provides significant performance improvement.",

      "abstract": "High-resolution acoustical imaging requires the use of short-duration (wideband) pulses for good resolution in range, and two-dimensional (2-D) transducer arrays for good resolution and scanning in both lateral directions. But 2-D arrays often contain an impractically large number of elements, so it is important to find sparse 2-D arrays which can perform as well as densely populated 2-D arrays. Boundary arrays are a particular class of sparse arrays which have elements located only on the boundary of some planar region. Signal processing techniques have been developed that effectively \"fill-in\" the missing elements in the interior of the boundary array. These techniques were originally proposed in the context of narrowband imaging of far-field scenes. In this paper we apply the techniques to near-field imaging with wideband pulses. Simulations indicate that the methods are effective in this context also, so 2-D boundary arrays can produce high-quality images in acoustical imaging applications.",

      "abstract": "Delays are an endemic feature of the construction industry. Typically, when a delay occurs in a project, the project manager often expedites progress through activity crashing with respect to available float and time-cost relationships. An accelerated schedule is thus obtained by either prescribing overtime working hours or procuring additional resources or a combination of both. However, excessively prolonged overtime work can generate quality problems, such as rework, and additional resources. There is therefore a need for a model to assist project managers with understanding the complex nature of attaining a trade-off between overtime working and the procurement of additional resources. In this paper, a system dynamics model for Mitigating Days in CONstruction (MiDiCON) due to the effects of prolonged overtime work on project costs and quality is presented To overcome project delays, several options representing various combinations of prescribing overtime work and injecting additional resources are analyzed. Utility theory is then applied to determine the most appropriate solution for mitigating project delays.",

      "abstract": "The present paper investigates the recoverability of detailed spectral features such as formant and burst peak frequencies of prevocalic stop consonants in noise excited channel vocoded speech for band widths ranging from 250-2000 Hz. It is shown that some formant frequency information is still recoverable up to 1000 Hz. This challenges the claim that listeners must necessarily rely primarily on temporal or global spectral features because such narrowly localized spectral properties are lost in noise vocoded speech. Listeners' categorization of these stimuli were modelled using empirically measured formant and burst peak frequencies as well as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients in order to evaluate the relative importance of each as correlates to place of articulation perception. It is found that despite a certain level of recoverability for detailed spectral features, spectral shape at burst and voicing onset are better correlates to listeners' perception of stop consonant place of articulation.",

      "abstract": "The emerging MPEG-4 standard enables direct access to individual objects in the video stream, along with boundary/shape, texture, and motion information about each object. This paper proposes an object-based video indexing method that is directly applicable to the MPEG-4 compressed video bitstreams. The method aims to provide object-based content-interactivity; thus, defines the audio-visual object as the indexing unit. The scheme involves object-based temporal segmentation of the video bitstream, selection of key-frames and key-video-object-planes, and characterization of the motion and/or shape of each video object including the background object. We also propose syntax and semantics for an indexing field to meet the content-based access requirement of MPEG-4. Experimental results are shown on two MPEG-4 test sequences.",

      "abstract": "French is characterized by the presence of a final stress at the end of rhythmic groups. Lexical processing could be facilitated for words whose right boundary also corresponds to the rhythmic-group boundary. Sentences were constructed with a target syllable at various positions relative to word and rhythmic-group boundaries. These sentences were presented to French listeners (experiment 1) and to Dutch listeners (experiment 2), whose task was to detect a target syllable. RT analysis suggests an influence of the syllable position within the rhythmic group, independently of its position in the word. The closer to the right edge of the rhythmic group the syllable was, the faster its detection. Although this pattern was quite similar for French and Dutch listeners, some differences suggest that French listeners, but not Dutch listeners, have taken advantage of specificities of French rhythm. Universal and language-specific procedures in speech perception are discussed.",

Unfortunately, approaches developed so far, both in time and frequency domain of the QRS complex suffers from a relatively low positive-predictive accuracy. Therefore, in this underscores it is required to improve methods. In this study, we investigated the applications of wavelet filter banks. To this effect it is then applied to the problem of distinguishing patients with and without late potential. In the course of the work, we studied the various accuracy scenarious using basic filtering and wavelet filtering techniques. We devoloped a new approach called subframe approximation and then we applied this approach to the wavelet filters. The real improvement is achieved in wavelet filtering method and discrete wavelet analysis that can be used in practice.",

      "abstract": "In video indexing, video scene transition detection is an essential step to segment the video. Current techniques used for scene change detection tend to suffer from a major limitation as most of them cannot identify scene transitions in the compressed domain. Since most videos are expected to be stored in the compressed domain, scene transition detection in this domain is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for real-time detection of abrupt scene transitions and fade-in/fade-out scene transitions using texture and macroblock (MB) information in the MPEG-4 compressed video. MPEG-4 video stream is partially decoded where texture and MB information are extracted. MB information is used to identity the abrupt scene transitions whereas MB information together with the texture difference between frames are used to identify the boundaries of fading transitions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is measured in terms of precision and recall values. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can identify fade and abrupt scene transitions with a mean recall and precision values equal to 80.76% and 85.71%, respectively.",

To facilitate the search through the set of switched predictors used for prediction of the input LSF(Line Spectral Frequencies) vector, the predictors are organized in a binary-tree structure. For the conventional full-searched SIVP coder with N=2b predictors, prediction must be performed for all of them to determine the best one, while only 2b predictions are sufficient for the proposed binary-tree searched coder. A design procedure for obtaining optimal binary-tree structured predictors is given. The effectiveness of the proposed coder is evaluated and results are compared to the baseline full-searched coders as a function of the number of predictors, and resolution of vector quantizers used for quantization of the prediction residual. Discussion of possible applications of the proposed coder is also given.",

Based on transformations for digital filters in the frequency domain, the filter results in a minimal number of parameters. In addition, a simple adaptive algorithm with good tracking and convergence properties is obtained by using all-pass filters and truncating the gradient. Computer simulations are included to verify the competitive performance of this filter under a wide range of conditions. From this analysis, we conclude that our new design is computationally simple, achieves rapid convergence, and is consequently a good choice in many non-stationary environments.",

This representation is used for geometric surface matching to 3-D medical image data, such as from magnetic resonance imaging iMRil. The parameterization decomposes the surface into sinusoidal basis functions. Four types of surfaces are modeled: tori, open surfaces, closed surfaces and tubes. This parameterization allows a wide variety of smooth surfaces to be described with a small number of parameters. Extrinsic model-based information is incorporated by introducing prior probabilities on the parameters. Surface finding is formulated as an optimization problem. Results of the method applied to synthetic images and 3-D medicai images of the heart and brain are presented.",

It is composed of two sub networks: A master which gives the main energy function (the error power between the master's output and a desired output), and a slave which gives a secondary energy function (related to the constraints imposed by the problem). The sum of these energy functions gives the cost function to be minimized by the CCNN. An extension of the classical back propagation algorithm to the complex plane, under some inequality constraints, is used for the training process. This model finds a natural application in the time-frequency analysis as it gives direct access to the time-frequency signature.",

The Berkeley project is particularly interesting from an image processing perspective because its testbed collection consists almost entirely of scanned materials. As a result, the Berkeley project is making extensive use of document recognition and other image analysis technology to provide content-based access to the collection. The Document Image Decoding (DID) group at Xerox PARC is a member of the Berkeley team and is investigating the application of DID techniques to providing high-quality (accurate and properly structured) transcriptions of scanned documents. This paper briefly describes the Berkeley project, discusses some of its recognition requirements and presents an example of an advanced structured document created using DID technology.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an efficient compression algorithm for very low bit-rate video applications. The algorithm is based on (1) optical-flow motion estimation to achieve more accurate motion prediction fields; (2) DCT-coding of the motion vectors from the optical-flow estimation to further reduce the motion overheads; and (3) region adaptive threshold technique to match optical flow motion prediction and minimize the residual errors. Unlike the classic block-matching based discrete cosine transformation (DCT) video coding schemes in MPEG 1/2 and H.261/3, the proposed algorithm uses optical flow for motion compensation and the DCT is applied to the optical flow field instead of predictive errors. Thresholding techniques are used to treat different regions to complement optical flow technique and to efficiently code residual data. While maintaining comparable peak signal to noise ratio (P-SNR) and computational complexity with that of ITU-T H.263/TMN5, the reconstructed video frames of the proposed coder are free of annoying blocking artifacts, and hence visually much more pleasant.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates a wavelet based de-noising of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to correct for the presence of the ocular artifact (OA). The proposed technique is based on an over-complete wavelet expansion of the EEG as follows: i) a stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is applied to the corrupted EEG; ii) the thresholding of the coefficients in the lower frequency bands is performed; iii) the de-noised signal is reconstructed. This paper demonstrates the potential of the proposed technique for successful OA correction. The advantage over conventional methods is that there is no need for the recording of the electrooculogram (EOG) signal itself. The approach works both for eye blinks and eye movements. Hence, there is no need to discriminate between different artifacts. To allow for a proper comparison, the contaminated EEG signals as well as the corrected signals are presented together with their corresponding power spectra.",

      "abstract": "This paper describes how the phase, obtained by Gabor filtering an image, can be used to aggregate related Gabor elements (simple features identified by peaks in the Gabor magnitude). This phase-based feature grouping simplifies the perennial problem of target/background segmentation because we need to only determine if the aggregate feature is target or background, rather than determine the status of each feature independently. Since the phase from a single quadrature Gabor output cannot tolerate large changes in orientation, a new local measure, referred to as the composite phase, has been developed. It is a combination of the filter responses from multiple orientations which allows the phase to follow contours with large changes in orientation. A constant composite phase contour is used to connect related Gabor elements that would otherwise appear separated within the magnitude response.",

In tests on two large corpora (WSJ and BNA) the bigram perplexity was reduced by up to 29%. Furthermore, this approach allows to tackle the problem of an open vocabulary with no unknown word.",

In most cases, the CT images are generated with the projection data set weighted prior to reconstruction, to combat motion artifacts, data inconsistency, or redundant data samples. In this paper, we investigate the potential bias introduced to the reconstruction as a result of the interaction of the projection weights and the isocenter misalignment (ISM). We demonstrate that when the weights applied to the conjugate rays are significantly different, bias will result which favors the sample with a higher weight. Although the error is not easily detected in axial CT images, it can be quite visible in 3-D or multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images. In this paper, we first present a theoretical framework to analyze and predict the bias. The theoretical prediction is validated by both computer simulations and phantom experiments. Several schemes to combat this artifact are subsequently presented; and their effectiveness is demonstrated.",
